# automod-bot
### Because lets automate Discords own automod

#### What does this do?
It makes it possible to create server unique configuration regarding the Discord automod and action, automtiaclly whenever a user reaches `X` amount of strikes (also know as infractions). For example user `Autally` says this bad word `pancake`, incase of this happening the bot keeps track of that and sends a fancy embed in the channel where the Discord automod logs are sent.

Here you can either timeout, kick or ban the user. The bot also offers a way to do actions autotamically after `X` strikes.
